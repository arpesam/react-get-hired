## About this project
This project was created to help those who were fired from their jobs because of Covid-19. The idea is to list jobs in various areas, so that people can easily consult these vacancies and relocate.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Some observations
This project was designed by Ant Design. As a challenge, I decided not to use the lib and make the UI as close to the lib as possible using pure Css.

The firebase apiKey is in the project, I know how dangerous it could be, but don't worry. The purpose is only show the application running without any pre set. 

## Structure
You can find the project entry point in the containers folder, there you will find App.jsx. Once in this component, it will be extremely easy to understand the structure of the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
